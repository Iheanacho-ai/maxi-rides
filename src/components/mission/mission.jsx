                    <h3>How It Started</h3>
                    <p className = 'info-p'>
                        It all started when I was working
                        at Victoria Island. 
                        I had to wake up everyday by 4:30am
                        to start preparing for work. 
                        Getting to the bus stop early 
                        doesn’t mean getting
                        to work early in the City of Lagos. 
                        While stuck in traffic numerous times, 
                        I noticed how empty most cars are. 
                        We are a team of workers 
                        that can’t afford cars 
                        nor the cost of online 
                        ridehailing companies
                        that came up with a cost effective
                        means of going to work everyday.
